/*Concept of Leap Year - 
The rule states:
“Every year that is exactly divisible by four is a leap year, except for years that are exactly divisible by 100, but these centurial years are leap years if they are exactly divisible by 400.”

For example,
if year = 2400, it is leap year,(Condition 1 satisfied)
but if year = 2200, is NOT a leap year, (Cond. 2 not satisfied),
and if year = 2020, is a leap year, (Cond. 2 satisfied).

To check whether a year is a leap year or not, you need to check the following 3 conditions:
IF
1. Any year that is divisible by 400 is definitely a leap year.
ELSE IF
2. If divisible by 4 AND not divisible by 100 then a leap year.
ELSE
not a leap year.
